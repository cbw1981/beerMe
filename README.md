BeerME

WHAT BEERME IS
This is an app that you put your city and state  into the search bar. Then all of the nearist breweries, cideries, brewpubs and bottleshops.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
We used a combination of 2 API's. We used open brewery DB and Apple maps.

FUTURE PLANS 
We would like to add in a rating service of beer types like a yelp api type of deal.

HOW TO RUN
To run the project you need to put your city and state and then all of the nearist breweries, cideries, brewpubs and bottleshops will pop up.
