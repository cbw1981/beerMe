BeerME

WHAT BEERME IS
beerMe is an app where you can search breweries by location.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
We used a combination of 3 APIs. We used OpenBreweryDB, Google Maps Embed, and Yelp Fusion.

FUTURE PLANS 
We would like to add a favoriting system so you can keep breweries you like in a stored location.

HOW TO RUN
To run the project you need to put your city and state and then all of the nearist breweries, cideries, brewpubs and bottleshops will pop up.
